        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><b>1/4</b> cup olive oil</p>
        <p><b>3</b> tablespoons red wine vinegar</p>
        <p><b>2</b> tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 lemon)</p>
        <p><b>1</b> clove garlic, minced</p>
        <p><b>3/4</b> teaspoon dried oregano</p>
        <p><b>1/2</b> teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        <p><b>1/4</b> teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p><b>1/2</b> small red onion, thinly sliced</p>
        <p><b>1/4</b> cup cold water</p>
        <p><b>4</b> salmon fillets, skin removed</p>
        <p><b>2</b> medium heads butter lettuce, such as Boston or Bibb (about 1 pound), torn into bite-sized pieces</p>
        <p><b>2</b> medium tomatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces</p>
        <p><b>1</b>  medium English cucumber, quartered lengthwise, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces</p>
        <p><b>1/2</b> cup pitted kalamata olives, halved lengthwise</p>
        <p><b>4</b> ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about 1 cup)</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><b>1</b> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 425°F. While the oven heats, marinate the salmon and soak the onions (instructions below).</p>

        <p><b>2</b> 
            Whisk the olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Transfer 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette to a baking dish large enough to hold all the pieces of salmon in one layer. Add the salmon, turning them over gently a few times to evenly coat in the vinaigrette. Cover and refrigerate. Place the onion and water in a small bowl and set aside for 10 minutes to make the onion less potent. Drain and discard the liquid.</p>

        <p><b>3</b> Uncover the salmon and roast until it is cooked through and flakes easily, 8 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer into the middle of the thickest fillet should register 120°F to 130°F for medium-rare, or 135°F to 145°F if you prefer it more well-done. Total cook time will depend on the thickness of salmon, based on the thickest part of the fillet. Meanwhile, compose the salad.</p>
        <p><b>4</b> Add the lettuce, tomato, cucumber, olives, and drained red onion to the bowl of vinaigrette and toss to evenly coat. Divide between 4 plates or shallow bowls. When the salmon is ready, place 1 fillet on top of each salad. Sprinkle with the feta and serve immediately.</p>
