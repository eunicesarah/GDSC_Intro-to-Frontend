        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><b>300g</b> strong bread flour</p>
        <p><b>1</b> tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</p>
        <p><b>1</b> tsp salt</p>
        <p><b>1</b> tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</p>
        <p><b>100ml</b> pasta</p>
        <p><b>1</b> garlic clove, crushed</p>
        <p><b>125g</b> ball mozzarella, sliced</p>
        <p>Grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)</p>
        <p>Cherry tomatoes, halved</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><b>1</b> Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then 
            stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm 
            water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon 
            until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface 
            and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can 
            leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>

        <p><b>2</b> 
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>

        <p><b>3</b> Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
        <p><b>4</b> Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p>
