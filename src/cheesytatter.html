     <p>Tater tots are grated potatoes formed into small cylinders and deep-fried, 
        often served as a side dish. The name "tater tot" is a registered trademark of the 
        American frozen food company Ore-Ida, but is often used as a generic term. "Tater" 
        is short for potato.</p>
